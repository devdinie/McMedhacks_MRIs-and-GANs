[McMed Hacks 2021](https://mcmedhacks.com/) was an 8-week long series of talks and workshops on medical imaging analysis and deep learning in Python. As mentors for week 6, we were in charge of preparing  an assignment on the topic of MR and GAN-based segmentation, as well as hosting tutorials and answering participant questions.
